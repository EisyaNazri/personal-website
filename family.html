<h3>
<p>For me, family is something that is very precious because nothing can replace the role of the family in this world. That's a place where I could find a peaceful and everlasting affection. 
I really love my family. My family consists of seven people they are my father, mother,  two older brothers and two younger sisters.<br />Although we are just a small family, our affection to each other is very large I'm very proud of them. And now I'll tell you about my family 
My father is a disciplined person. He always teaches me and my siblings not to waste our  time.<br />
My father is so different with other disciplined person. Even though he is so  discipline, he remains friendly and understands our needs. My father is a village worker. My father is almost busy with his work but he never forgets his family. 
He always invites us to go to vacation every weekend. He thinks our happiness is his happiness too.<br /></p>
<p>My mom is just a housewife. Actually she used to be a teacher. However, my father asked her to stop and focus on taking care of the family. She is a woman who is very patient and diligent in taking care of the family. 
<br />She always does her task with full of love. I think my mother is also the best chef She always cooks delicious food for us However, sometimes she is very fussy but I realizes that it was all for our own good. 
My older brother was graduated at 2022 and now he was substitute teacher at primary school. My second older brother is very spoiled. Sometimes he is annoying and often makes me angry Even though, I am very fond of him. He is still study.<br />
He has a dream to become engineer. My father is very happy to know my brother's dream. He always supports my brother to make it comes true. My two younger sisters still study at primary school and secondory school.<br /> 
That's my little family. A family which I love the most, we always support and love each other. I wish we could stay together in joy and sorrow.</p>
